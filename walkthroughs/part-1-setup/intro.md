# Intro

Hi! I’m Jason Han and I’ll be your host for this 10-week project. First, there will be a five step walkthrough to teach you about the basics of web development and get your environment set up. It should take around 2-3 weeks to get through.

Let's get started!

## Issues

If you happen to run into any issues, don’t worry! There’s bound to be at least a few. Let me know over Slack and I should respond quickly.

## Command Line

We’ll be using the command line extensively throughout this project, and the instructions assume you use a Unix shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.). If you’ve never used the command line before, feel free to reach out to me over on Slack and/or use Google to learn the basics.

**Windows**: Windows is not a Unix-like environment, meaning there are no Unix shells installed. [Here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) is a tutorial on how to enable Bash in Windows 10.

## Walkthroughs

This repo is split up into directories that contain the projects you'll be
working on in five steps.

Wherever you see a file that ends with `-walkthrough.md`, you can look at it on GitHub (navigate to it) or use a Markdown reader to render it correctly.

## The `portfolio` Directory

The `portfolio` directory contains a bare-bones web app that you'll use to create
your own personal portfolio page!

## The `walkthroughs` Directory

The `walkthroughs` directory contains the projects you'll be working on over the
next few weeks. Each subdirectory introduces a new concept and includes
examples. You'll use these to build your portfolio page!

You can peek at the files now to get an idea of what you'll be doing, and you'll
get more specific instructions each week.

## Congratulations!

You finished this introduction!

Next, you'll write HTML and JavaScript to create a portfolio page, and you'll
deploy it to App Engine so anyone can visit it.

When you're ready, start the next walkthrough by opening the `part-2-portfolio` folder.
